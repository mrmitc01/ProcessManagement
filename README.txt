ProcessManagement

The goal of this project is to take one command-line argument, check that it is a number at least 3 and at most 10, and create that number of processes using fork().

The purposes of each of the following files are stated below:


forker.c - to create a given number of processes and print each child's process ID and exit status
forker.h - to define various constants
tester.c - to test the program


Compile the source code by typing the following at the prompt $:
$ gcc -o tester tester.c
$ gcc -o forker forker.c

Code is available upon request
